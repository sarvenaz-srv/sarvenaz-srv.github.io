I am currently a senior undergraduate student at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I have been actively working and doing research in these fields for the past two years. My research goal is to introduce innovative approaches that can solve problems in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
Besides my research experience, I am passionate about expanding my knowledge by teaching. As a result, I have volunteered as a teaching assistant in numerous courses.
