I have 3 semesters (Spring 2022, Spring 2023, Fall 2023) experience of working as a teaching assistant of Principles and Applications of Artificial Intelligence course presented by Dr. Mahdi Javanmardi. During these semesters I have been defining exercises for this course in order to help the students learn more.
