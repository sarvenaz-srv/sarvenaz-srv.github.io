For my final year thesis project, I am embarking on the development of an answer generator for a persian chatbot. Recognizing the intent of every sentence in conversations, this chatbot generates an answer and continues the conversation to complete the queries where needed.
I have worked on training mT5 model for answer generation on a dataset collected based on MultiWOZ-like scenarios.
